# NamelessMC Wiki Module
A custom wikipedia module created for NamelessMC v1.0.16

-

**Note 1:** *This module was customly created for my servers website, so data in here must be changed before using it.*
**Note 2:** *This module isn't exactly a user-friendly "module", instead it is a collection of .php files that are put in your /pages/ directory.*

-

## Installation
- Download the latest code and delete README.md
- Create a folder in your /pages/ directory called "wiki"
- Upload the rest of the downloaded files to the wiki folder
- In your website, head to AdminCP -> Custom pages
- Create a new custom page, name it "Wiki" (leave the content empty)
- Select permissions for the page
- Head into the /pages/wiki/ directory and edit the following:
- - <!-- Index Description --> (The description of the wiki on the index page)
- - <!-- Navigation --> (The links on the side of the wiki pages)
